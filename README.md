Education and jobs are fundamental needs for a secure future, yet access to these opportunities varies widely. Many individuals from small towns must move to big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai. A significant challenge they face is finding affordable housing. High rents make it difficult to live alone, but what if they could find a suitable roommate before arriving in the city?

Our app, ROOMMATES, addresses this need. It allows users to find and contact potential roommates in advance, making it easier to secure housing and share expenses. This solution alleviates the stress of finding accommodation, offering a smoother transition to city life.
